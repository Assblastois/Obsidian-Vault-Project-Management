This is my personal Project Management Vault. 

I managed to automate most of it mainly relying on Dataview, Templater, Quickadd and Buttons. I created a thread on the Obsidian Forum where I go in depth of how my Vault works. This is always subject to change, depending on my current situation, but the logic stays fundamentally the same. Feel free to adapt and change "Project quickadd template.md" (located in Background/Templates for quickadd) to your needs. Just be careful with the Quickadd plugin because it is rather delicate and can break easily!

Enjoy!
